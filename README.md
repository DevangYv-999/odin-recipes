Project: Recipes

Aim: To create a Recipes website with links to a few recipes.

Outcome: 


- I learnt about creating a website using HTML. Source- The Odin Project
- The goal was to create a Recipes websites with three different kinds of recipes pages embedded in it using hyperlinks, when clicked on any recipe the page should open in a new tab. I made three different recipe subpages in the recipes subfolder.
- A index.html file was created. What I learnt was that naming should be correct because the web server  will look specifically for the index.html in the specific directory and also because of the Search Engine Optimization.
-Talking about how I coded it, According to the great instructors/contributors that had writted The Odin Project website.
-I first made the main index.html file, added the boilerplate, added basic encodings and headings, then used the href attribute to embed the different recipes into the main page.
-In the Recipes subfolder, I created three different recipes html files(.html) and named it according to my recipes.
-Inside one of my recipes html file (biryani.html), I started adding the usual boiler plate,encodings(UTF-8),headers,title. The next step was to add the image using the img src attribute.
-I continued adding the required information that was in the assignments of the Odin Project. The addition was to include a image of the recipe, along with steps and description.
-I added the steps and description using the ordered and unorderes lists attributes.

-Thankyou Odin Project for the free and premium quality resources. Open source community is truly amazing and helpfull! even the people on their disord servers are helpfull.

-(The above README.md is typed without much efforts or thinking as it was simply just a test upload! So I wrote whatever that came to my mind and also to practice the GIT commands of pushing after modifying a file)
