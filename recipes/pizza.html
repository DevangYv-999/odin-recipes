  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>In preparing for the second challenge of Project Food Blog, I came across a line in the prompt that says "We're bypassing the French and Italian standards in favor of more challenging cuisines.". The problem is, I'm Japanese, so cooking an "exotic" Asian dish felt like it was cheating. That's why I decided to make a dish that's ubiquitous and utterly simple, and yet it's something that is made wrong ninety-nine times out of a hundred. Yep, that's right, I'm making a classic pizza.</p>
  
  <p>Not Chicago deep-dish, or even a New York-style fold-in-half thin crust, and most certainly not some new-fangled California-style pizza with, ohh... say some blasphemous combo like kimchi and pork belly on it. Since I've never set foot in Naples, this meant hitting stacks of bound fiber inscribed with contrasting pigment. Yes my friends, this food blogger, walked over to a bookshelf and used a table of contents to research the history of a true Neapolitan pizza.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Water</li>
	<li>Active dry yeast</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Bread flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the dough, dissolve the yeast and salt in a large bowl with the water. Add the flour and use some long chopsticks to stir together (okay they probably didn't use chopsticks in Italy during the 19th century, but they work so well because they don't have much surface area for the dough to stick to). Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for at least 12 hours, or overnight in the fridge.</li>
	<li>Cut a cross hatch on the bottom of the tomatoes (opposite of where the stem connected) to keep them from popping. Put some water in a pot and place a steamer rack in the pot. Place the tomatoes cut-side-up on the rack. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then cover and steam the tomatoes until they are soft to the touch (about 10 minutes). Remove the lid and let them cool off enough to handle.<li>
	<li>Remove the skins, then place them in a stainer and use a pestle or the bottom of the spoon to press the tomato through. It would be faster to use a blender first before straining, but Queen Margherita's chef in Naples didn't have a blender. Plus using a blender would break up the seeds which would add a slightly bitter taste to the sauce.</li>
