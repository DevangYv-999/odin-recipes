  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) is without a doubt one of the most well known Indian dishes around the world. Maybe it's the name (can you think of a more decadent sounding name?), or perhaps it has a flavor profile that appeals across cultures. Whatever the reason, Murgh Makhani has managed to find its way around the globe, showing up on menus from Toronto to Tokyo to Turin</p>
  
  <p>While I love butter chicken, I have a few problems with many restaurant versions. The first is that it's often sugary sweet. The second issue is that it's often made with leftover tandoori chicken, which by the time it makes it into the butter sauce, could make the cut for an NHL approved hockey puck.</p>
